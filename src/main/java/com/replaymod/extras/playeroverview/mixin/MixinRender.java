/**
 * This mixin prevents players that are hidden in the PlayerOverview from being rendered.
 *
 * Cancelling the RenderPlayerEvent.Pre is insufficient because it affects neither the shadows nor the fire texture.
 * See: https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/2987
 *
 * The previous solution was to overwrite the RenderPlayer instances which has been dropped in favor of this one
 * because it is less compatible with other mods whereas this one should be fine as long as no other mod completely
 * overwrites the shouldRender method.
 * One example of the previous solution breaking is when used with VanillaEnhancements because it replaces the
 * RenderManager with a new custom one which in turn will reset our registered RenderPlayer instances because
 * it does so after we have already registered with the old RenderManager.
 *
 * For 1.7.10, that method doesn't exist, so we use a combination of the event and inject into
